<summary>Do I have to be familiar with cryptocurrencies to play it?</summary>

Garbles is a crypto game built for everyone, crypto and non-crypto users. Even if you don't know anything about blockchains, you can still play and have fun! If you don't have a crypto wallet, just signup with one of your social accounts and we'll create one for you in the game itself. You will still own and maintain the custody of all your assets (thanks to Web3auth). Easy as that!

<summary>Is Garbles a P2E game?</summary>

Completing missions to fight polluting trash monsters or completing daily challenges will get you rewards in the form of game items, NFT or tokens. Garbles is way more than an unsustanable P2E though! We are designing the game economy to balance the fun, incentives and positive impact on the planet.&#x20;

<summary>Do I have to pay to play Garbles?</summary>

You can start playing Garbles for free! To make the most out of the game though, a small amount of SOL may be beneficial to get a [transmuter](../gameplay/resources/nft/transmuters.md) before anybody else or mint the [NFT](../gameplay/resources/consumables/) that you find around. You can either transfer SOL to your game wallet or use the upcoming credit card integrations if you don't own any crypto outside of the game.&#x20;
