<summary>Do I have to be familiar with cryptocurrencies to play it?</summary>

Garbles is a crypto game built for everyone, crypto and non-crypto users. Even if you don't know anything about blockchains, you can still play and have fun! A wallet is always required, but you either use one like Phantom, or just signup with a social account and we'll create one for you in the game itself (using Web3auth). You will still own and have custody of all your assets. Easy as that!

<summary>Do I have to pay to play Garbles?</summary>

You can start playing Garbles without spending any money! To make the most out of the game though, you will need a small amount of SOL to get a [transmuter](../gameplay/resources/nft/transmuters.md) or mint the [NFT](../gameplay/resources/nft/) that you find around. You can either transfer SOL to your game wallet or use the upcoming credit card integrations if you don't own any crypto outside of the game.&#x20;
