# Explore

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1604 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Points-of-interests on the map are playable spots where NFT and Items will spawn.</p></figcaption></figure>

The goal of Exploration is to collect the most trash resources you can find around the map so you can reuse them to Transmute. All items are NFT that are free to mint and owned by the players. Everyone can easily set up a wallet, choosing their preferred option. Make sure it is funded to pay for the transaction cost (which on Solana is less than a penny!)\
\
Here's the list of resources available in Garbles by category. \
****\
**Consumable**\
****- [Eggs](../resources/nft/eggs.md)\
\- [Trash Items](../resources/nft/trash-items.md)\
\- **** [Berries](../resources/game-items/candies.md)****\
****  \
**Equipment**\
****- [Transmuter](../resources/nft/transmuters.md)\
\- [Vacuum Cleaner](../resources/nft/vacuum-cleaner.md)\
\- [Badges](../resources/nft/badges.md)\
\
Learn more about each [Resource](../resources/) on the relative page.

The first player to clear a zone can claim control over that area through a Transmuter. Transmuters can only be activated by their owners and are used to transmute garbage into Garbles. Check out how [Transmuters](../resources/nft/transmuters.md) and the [Transmutations](transmutation.md) process work.

With enough Garbles, players can participate in Raids, time-based missions to fight trash and obtain rewards. Raids opportunities are monitored on the map. Learn more about [Raids](raid.md) dynamics on the relative section.&#x20;
