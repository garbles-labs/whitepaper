  Exploration mode is all about cleaning the planet while discovering Items and
  NFTs.

# Explore

The goal of Exploration is to collect the most trash resources you can find around the map so you can reuse them to Transmute. All items are NFT that are free to mint and owned by yourself. Every player has a wallet, you just have to make sure it is funded to pay for the mint cost (which is less than a penny on Solana!)\
\
Here's the list of resources available in Garbles, by category. \
****\
**Consumable**\
****- [Eggs](../resources/nft/eggs.md)\
\- [Trash Items](../resources/nft/trash-items.md)\
\- **** [Berries](../resources/game-items/candies.md)****\
****  \
**Equipment**\
****- [Transmuter](../resources/nft/transmuters.md)\
\- [Vacuum Cleaner](../resources/nft/vacuum-cleaner.md)\
\- [Badges](../resources/nft/badges.md)\
\

The first player to clear a zone can claim control over that area through a Transmuter. Transmuters can only be activated by their owners and are used to transmute garbage into garbles. Check out how [Transmuters](../resources/nft/transmuters.md) and the [Transmutations](transmutation.md) process work.

With enough Garbles, players can participate in Raids, time-based missions to fight trash and obtain rewards. Raids opportunities are monitored on the map. Learn more about [Raids](raid.md) dynamics on the relative section.&#x20;
