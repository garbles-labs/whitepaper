All Sweepers are equipped with a [Vacuum Cleaner](../resources/nft/vacuum-cleaner.md). It is your primary tool to suck--in resources and clean up the environment. Tap into an Egg or a Trash Item to prompt Capture mode. Remember, the mint is free (if you are able to capture the items), but you have to make sure your wallet is funded. If you don't know how to do it, here's a simple guide that will help you. \

It is your duty as a Sweeper to vacuum up whatever objects you may find in your proximity and accumulate resources to generate Garbles. The likelihood of collecting certain Items depends on your vacuum model so keep an eye on the latest customization!
