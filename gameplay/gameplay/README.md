Garbles is a geolocation-based, on-chain mobile game where you can create infinite combinations of trash-based monsters after collecting [NFT](../resources/nft/) resources and removing [on-chain C02](../resources/c02-tokens.md).\
\
Sweepers can explore their surroundings to find Eggs, Trash Items and other useful scrap materials. All these resources can be freely minted as NFTs and are owned by the players. The trash items and the Eggs are needed to give birth to a baby Garble by means of the Transmutation process. [Trasmuters](../resources/nft/transmuters.md) are powerful machines that can turn specific types of garbage into a unique combination of attributes. The link between trash items and garbles is not clear and it's up to you to find out! When they are energized with enough [$NUCLEAR](../resources/#nuclear), Transmuters remove actual [CO2](../resources/c02-tokens.md) from the environment but can also give birth to trash-producing monsters. These must be rapidly eradicated before they pollute even further. After you have assembled a litter of Garbles, take part in [raids](raid.md) against nasty piles of trash that occasionally spawn in the middle of your city and play daily mini-games to collect [Resources](../resources/) and get other exciting [Rewards](../resources/game-items/).&#x20;
