Garbles is a geolocation-based AR mobile game that allows players to collect [**NFT**](../resources/nft/) and[ **on-chain carbon credits**](../resources/c02-tokens.md) **** while removing trash and generating cute creatures. \
\
Sweepers can explore their surroundings to collect eggs, waste materials and other useful scrap items. All these resources are available around the map and can be minted as NFTs directly in the game. Trash items can be combined with eggs to give birth to an army of adorable, trash-eating Garbles. To generate the creatures a [Transmuter](../resources/#transmuter) is required. Trasmuters are powerful machines that can turn different types of garbage into garbles, if energized with enough [$NUCLEAR](../resources/#nuclear). The process requires at least an egg and three trash objects, all to be found around our polluted world. The reaction will remove actual [CO2](../resources/c02-tokens.md) from the environment. After having assembled a litter of garbles, players can take part in [raids](raid.md) against nasty piles of trash that may occasionally spawn in the middle of their cities and play daily mini-games to collect [Resources](../resources/) and other exciting [Rewards](../resources/game-items/).&#x20;
