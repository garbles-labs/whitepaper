# Capture

All Sweepers (players) are equipped with a powerful vacuum cleaner, which is their primary tool to collect resources. Finding an egg or a trash item prompts Capture mode, that consist in your chance to suck the object in. Remember, it's your duty as a sweeper to vacuum up whatever objects you may find in your proximity!\
\
Vacuum cleaners require [Cartridges](../resources/game-items/cartridges.md) to function. Cartridges are items themselves and can be found within trash bags. If you run out of Cartridges, search in your surrounding to find them and recharge.&#x20;

### Capture activites

* Collect and mint Eggs as NFT.
* Collect and mint Trash Items as NFT.&#x20;
