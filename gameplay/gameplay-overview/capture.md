# Capture

All Sweepers (players) are equipped with a powerful vacuum cleaner, which is their primary tool to collect resources. Finding an egg or a trash item prompts Capture mode. This is your chance to suck in the object with your vacuum cleaner and mint it! Remember, it's your duty as a sweeper to vacuum up whatever objects you may find in your proximity to accumulate precious resources and progress in the game. \
\
Vacuum cleaners require [Cartridges](../resources/game-items/cartridges.md) to function. Cartridges are items themselves and can be found within trash bags. If you run out of Cartridges, search in your surrounding to recharge.&#x20;
