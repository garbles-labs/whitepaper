# Raid

Raids are missions played with garbles to clean areas invaded by a colony of trash-based monsters. These filthy creatures have nothing in common with Garbles! First off, they are incredibly smelly and nasty to say the least. Sometimes, these awful piles of garbage can even become huge enough to threaten the whole city.  Sweepers must intervene timely to root out the enemy. By deploying their Garbles they can consume garbage before it spread further around. Once a pile of trash is exhausted, it releases a random combination of rewards, including [Game Items](../resources/game-items/), [Trash Items](../resources/nft/trash-items.md) and [$NUCLEAR](../tokenomics/usdnuclear.md). Different types of trash piles will let our related kinds of objects (i.e. plastic piles will tend to release plastic-type objects).

Raids can be played with team members from the same Team. In fact, it increases the chance of obtaining rewards. Rewards are split pro-rata according to the contribution of each owns garbles. A global leaderboard keeps track of the score of Teams.&#x20;
