# Transmutation

Transmutation is the process of turning garbage into garbles. To do so, you need at least these  resources:

* 1 Egg
* 3 Trash Items
* A Transmuter
* NUCLEAR

[Transmuters](../resources/nft/transmuters.md) are the powerful machines used to generate Garbles. They are impressive pieces of technology that have been engineered by Cleantists to merge garbage with eggs and ultimately recycle waste into Garbles. Transmuters are the only way to carry out the transmutation process in the various life stages of garbles. They can be minted and activated by their owner, or "rented". Due to their inherent production complexity, Transmuters are limited!\
\
If you are able to clear an area on the map successfully, you can mint and activate a Transmuter to exert your control over that zone. As owner of the transmuter, you are entitled to use it in perpetuity and will receive a fee from other Sweepers who need to transmute their garbage but don't own one. Transmuters must be energized with enough $NUCLEAR to trigger a reaction.&#x20;
