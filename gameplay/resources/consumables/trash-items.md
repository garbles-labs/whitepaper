# Trash items

Trash items are the unfortunate byproduct of human expansion on Earth. Luckily the smart Cleantists have found a way to turn them into Garbles, by accelerating the hatching process of  Eggs.

Trash Items can be found around the map or obtained in Raids.&#x20;

Their properties are:

* `Type`
* `Luminescence`
* `Odor`
* `Toxicity`
* `Condition`

Up to 3 Trash items can be used in the Transmutation process.
