Transmuters are a technological wonder created by Cleantist. They are used to combine Trash Items with Eggs and give birth to myriads of unique Garbles. When energized with $NUCLEAR energy, these high-end machines can trigger a reaction that melts garbage with the outer surface of the egg, causing it to hatch immediately and altering its genetic code. They are the ultimate equipment for building your army of trash-eating monsters!

Transmuters are scarce and can be found and placed around specific point-of-interest on the map in Exploration mode. The lucky owner of a Transmuter can use it in perpetuity for their own transmutation and receive a "rent" from other players that want to access it themselves.&#x20;
