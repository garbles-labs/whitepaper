Transmuters are a technological wonder created by Cleantist. They are used to combine Trash Items with Eggs to give birth to Garbles. This is because when energized with $NUCLEAR, these high-end machines are able to trigger a reaction that melts garbage with the outer surface of the egg, causing it to hatch immediately. They are the ultimate equipment for building your army of trash-eating monsters!

Transmuters are scarce and can be found and minted around specific point-of-interest on the map in Exploration mode. The lucky owner of a Transmuter can use it in perpetuity and receive a "rent" from other players that want to perform a transmutation themselves. Sweepers who get in front of a transmuter can interact with it and a portion of the $NUCLEAR used to trigger the reaction will accrue to the owner.&#x20;
