# Eggs

Eggs are one of the main resources to be collected in Exploration mode. Eggs are valuable because they can give birth to Garbles if merged with a combination of Trash Items. They need a Transmuter (and $NUCLEAR) to hatch and generate a Garble.&#x20;

Eggs have the following traits:

* `Primary DNA`
* `Secondary DNA`

Eggs are themselves dependent on the kind of garbage they originate from. The most common types of eggs are:&#x20;

* `Plastic`
* `Organic`
* `Metallic`
* `Oil`
* `Chemical`
* `Radioactive`

There are rumours among Cleantists about the existence of other types of Eggs, but nobody has ever seen them in person to confirm.&#x20;
