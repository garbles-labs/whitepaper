# Trash items

Trash items are the unfortunate byproduct of human expansion on Earth. Luckily the smart Cleantist have found a way to turn them into Garbles, by accelerating the hatching process of  Eggs.

Trash Items can be mostly found in Trash Bags and after completing Raids.&#x20;

Their properties are:

* `Type`
* `Size`
* `Colour`
* `Toxicity`
* `Digestibility`

Up to 3 Trash items can be used in the Transmutation process.
