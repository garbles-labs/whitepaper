Resources are mostly found in Trash Bags or after completing Raids. NFTs are those resources that can be either **** used in the game, collected or traded in the Marketplace. Game items are only useful in the game but cannot be traded. Resources are the main target of exploration mode and are instrumental to competing in the global leaderboard.&#x20;
