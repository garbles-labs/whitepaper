# ðŸ’Ž Resources

Resources can either be NFT or Game Items. They can be found around the map, within Trash Bags or after completing Raids. NFTs are those resources that can be **** used in the game, collected and traded in the Marketplace. Game items are only useful in the game but cannot be traded in the marketplace. Resources are the main target of exploration mode and are instrumental to competing in the global leaderboard.&#x20;
