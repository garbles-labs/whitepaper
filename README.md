## Welcome to Garbles, Sweepers!

Trash has become so abundant on our planet that humans don't know how to store it anymore. Luckily, a group of smart scientists (we call them Cleantists) has found a way to cultivate goofy creatures that appear to be the perfect solution to the problem! 🗑️ \
&#x20;\
Garbles are cute, clumsy monsters originating from garbage. Create thousands of unique combinations of Garbles, mixing up the trash resources you find around the world. Every time you create a Garble, you are removing C02 and cleaning the planet for real! Help them dove into our dumpsters and gobble up every plastic bottle you can find. Assemble an army of lovable creatures and embark on a journey to populate the planet...while cleaning it!\
