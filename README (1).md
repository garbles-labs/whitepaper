## Welcome, Sweepers!

Garbles is the first game of the Magiblock ecosystem. \
\
Trash has become so abundant on our planet that humans don't know how to store it anymore. Luckily, a group of smart scientists (we call them Cleantists) has found a way to cultivate goofy creatures that appear to be the perfect solution to the problem! 🗑️ \
&#x20;\
Garbles are cute, quirky creatures originating from garbage. Create thousands of unique combinations of Garbles, mixing up the trash resources you find around the world. Collect precious C02 resources, assemble an army of lovable monsters and embark on a journey to populate the planet...while cleaning it!\
